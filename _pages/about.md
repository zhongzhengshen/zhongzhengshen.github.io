[The Validity of Conditional Reasoning Test: Theoretical Foundations, Validity Evidence, and Future Challenges](*Under Review*)

Zhaohui Zhang, **ZhongZheng Shen**, YiYi Zhang, Ran Bian*

- Conditional reasoning test is a standard implicit projection test, which consist of a series of logical reasoning tasks. It measures implicit motives, personality and behavioral tendencies by measuring individuals’ implicit cognitive biases (i.e. justification mechanisms) among their reasoning. With the continuous development of theory and application, CRT has accumulated a large amount of validity evidences, including criterion-related validity, incremental validity, and construct validity. However, the construct validity of CRT is still remain controversial, the core problem—“what to measure” remains to be resolve. Based on the researches above, to further improve the validity of the CRT, we need to (1) explore the test structure based on justification mechanisms; (2) clarify the underlying mechanism of CRT; (3) look for cross-cultural factors affecting CRT results; (4) limit the influence of the measuring principle leakage on the measurement results, providing a foundation for the subsequent research.
